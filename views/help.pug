    | These are the access levels of access codes that are displayed on the editor page of each resolution.

              block
        +row("Everyone (Delegates)", "DE")
          | This level means that there is no specific access restriction and the resolution can be viewed by anyone with the token. No access code is needed for this level.
        +row("The Approval Panel", "AP")
          | Editing is restricted to the Approval Panel. Resolutions are restricted to this access level when they are in stage #[a(href="#rstage2") #2].
        +row("The Formal Clearing", "FC")
          | Editing is restricted to the Formal Clearing. Resolutions are restricted to this access level when they are in stage #[a(href="#rstage3") #3].
        +row("The Secretariat", "SC")
          | The Secretariat enters its access code in stage #[a(href="#rstage3") #4] to signify that the resolution is being printed and is to be advanced to stage #5. It doesn't have editing access though.
        +row("Chairs", "CH")
          | Chairs always have unrestricted access to resolutions. This overrides other restrictions, such as the levels FC and AP. This is the maximum level found on a resolution. Chairs can use LiveView when a resolution is being debated.
        +row("Administration", "MA")
          | This level represents unrestricted access to all available functions of the website including LiveView. This also includes changing access levels of specific codes or giving out new access codes.

    h4#formatting Formatting Advice and Special Characters
    p This section will inform you about the formatting rules and special character restrictions in resolutions. This is about the formal and syntactical aspects only; for content advice, see the #[a(href="/help/contentguidelines") Content Guidelines].
    h5.light Formatting Advice: Special Syntax
    p The editor will attempt to make syntax become obvious to the user by providing interface elements that facilitate the different aspects of writing and formatting a resolution. However, in some special cases it is unavoidable to use special syntax to achieve some formatting types within clause content. Use this special formatting sparingly, only when necessary and not as a generic stylistic device.

        +row("Italics", "<em>A/RES/69/154</em>, <em>UNESCO Declaration...</em>", ["*A/RES/69/154*", "*UNESCO Declaration...*"])
          | Insert Asteriks #[code *] around the text you want to be rendered in #[em italics]. Apply italics to emphasise resolution identifiers like #[em A/RES/69/154] or names of formal documents, bodies or institutions.
        +row("Single character subscript", "H<sub>2</sub>O, CO<sub>2</sub>", ["H_2O", "CO_2"])
          | Characters preceded by an underscore #[code _] will be rendered as subscript. Use this to correctly display molecular formulas.
        +row("Multiple character subscript", "C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>6</sub>", "C_6H_12|O_6")
          | Use the underscore character #[code _], the text you want to be rendered as a subscript followed by the pipe character #[code |] to correctly display molecular formulas that involve subscripts consisting of multiple characters.
        +row("Single character superscript", "Na<sup>+</sup>", "Na^+")
          | Characters preceded by an circumflex #[code ^] will be rendered as superscript.
        +row("Multiple character superscript", "7<sup>th</sup> of May, 42<sup>nd</sup> edition", ["7^th| of May", "42^nd| edition"])
          | Use the circumflex character #[code ^], the text you want to be rendered as a superscript followed by the pipe character #[code |] to correctly display ordinal numbers.
