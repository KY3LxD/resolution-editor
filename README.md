 run with `DEBUG=myapp:* npm start` or `set DEBUG=myapp:* & npm start` when in development depending on your OS. The server will then respond on the default node dev port `3000`.
 
 install after cloning the repo with `npm install` (I can try to help you to set this up if you run into problems unsolvable with google)
