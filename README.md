 run with `DEBUG=myapp:* npm start` or `set DEBUG=myapp:* & npm start` when in development depending on your OS. The server will then respond on the default node dev port `3000`.
 
 install after cloning the repo with `npm install` (I can try to help you to set this up if you run into problems unsolvable with google)
 
 You will also have to install the LaTeX rendering library and pandoc in order to run the pdf rendering part of the server.
 
 Code style has to be adapted to the already used style and kept as consistent as possible.
 Including but not limited to the following:
 - Indent everything with 2 spaces
 - Use JSHint with the given configuration file to validate your code before comitting (and remove all errors!)
 
 Here are some screenshots if you don't want to/can't get the repo to run on your machine: (from 26 Jun 2017)
