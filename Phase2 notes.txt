Token is generated for each resolution
  example: @H3TA79NK
  8 digits long
  capital letters and numbers but without easy to confuse characters
  Sessions not necessary
  access resolutions with …/resolution/:token and then use POST to enter special access code
  last three chars in code are used to check if the code is a ok code (hash of the rest of the code)
  @ for tokens and ! for access codes
